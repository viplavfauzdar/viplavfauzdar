## 👋 Hi, I'm Viplav

I'm a hands-on engineering leader with 25+ years of experience building scalable backend systems, APIs, and cloud-native solutions across Fortune 1000 companies and startups. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## 🤖 Lately, I've been building with AI:
- Building **agentic AI workflows** with LangChain, Streamlit, and Ollama
- Developing **real-time trading dashboards** with LSTM models, sentiment feeds, and Alpaca integration
- Creating **research assistants** using Graph-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Running **self-hosted LLMs** (LLaMA, Mistral) for private inference and automation
- Experimenting with **Raspberry Pi IoT** projects like smart garage door control
- Exploring **agentic AI agents** (autonomous workflows, planning & reasoning)  
- Prototyping **AI-powered local SEO & outreach agents** with Python + LangChain  

## 🔧 Other things I build:
- Enterprise microservices & APIs with Java/Spring Boot  
- Full-stack apps with React, TypeScript, and FastAPI  
- CI/CD + observability with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Grafana  
- Data systems: BigQuery, Spanner, MongoDB, Neo4j (graph queries)  

## 🚀 Now Building
- AI Trading Bot (LSTM + live dashboard)  
- Agentic Research Assistant (Graph-RAG powered)  
- Raspberry Pi Smart Garage (local-first control)  
- Niche Radar AI (Shopify/AliExpress product research agent)  
- Real Estate Deal Screener (ARV prediction + AI insights, Streamlit → React/FastAPI)  
- AI-Powered Chat UI (Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Ollama streaming backend)  
- AI Consultant Portfolio (Astro + Netlify, with Medium integration)

## 🛠️ DIY Projects
### 🚪 Smart Garage Door Opener
- Built with Raspberry Pi, MQTT, and Siri Shortcuts. Includes remote control UI and door status monitoring.

### 📞 Call Center Analytics Tool
- Visualizes call history patterns for supervisors (e.g., transfers, holds). Built with Spring Boot, React, and MariaDB.
### 📡 TV Feed Streaming Prototype (2004)
- Streamed live TV over the internet using a TV tuner card, VLC, and Windows Media Encoder.
- Built before mainstream streaming platforms existed.

### 🌐 Peer-to-Peer File Sharing (2001)
- After Napster was blocked, I prototyped a simple decentralized file-sharing tool in Java.

### 📶 Neighborhood Wi-Fi Sharing (2003)
- Shared broadband securely with neighbors using consumer routers and custom firmware — an early look at community networks.

### 🍽️ Online Food Ordering App (1999)
- Created for a grad school project — featured menu browsing and order submission well before Grubhub or DoorDash.
