## 👋 Hi, I'm Viplav

I'm a hands-on engineering leader with 25+ years of experience building scalable backend systems, APIs, and cloud-native solutions across Fortune 1000 companies and startups. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## 🤖 Lately, I've been building with AI:
- 🧠 Developing **AI agents** and automation tools using **LangChain**, **Ollama**, **Gradio**, and **Streamlit**
- 🔐 Leveraging **LLaMA 3**, **Mistral**, and other open-source LLMs for **private, local inference**
- 📲 Integrating with **FastAPI**, **Python**, and **iOS Shortcuts** to create mobile-friendly personal assistants
- 🗂️ Using **vector search**, toolchains, and context-aware workflows for agentic applications

## 🔧 Other things I build:
- Microservices & REST APIs with Spring Boot
- End-to-end DevSecOps pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Data-driven platforms with GCP BigQuery, MongoDB, Spanner, and Neo4j
- DIY tech experiments like a Raspberry Pi–powered smart garage door

## 🛠️ DIY Projects
### 🚪 Smart Garage Door Opener
- Built with Raspberry Pi, MQTT, and Siri Shortcuts. Includes remote control UI and door status monitoring.

### 📞 Call Center Analytics Tool
- Visualizes call history patterns for supervisors (e.g., transfers, holds). Built with Spring Boot, React, and MariaDB.
### 📡 TV Feed Streaming Prototype (2004)
- Streamed live TV over the internet using a TV tuner card, VLC, and Windows Media Encoder.
- Built before mainstream streaming platforms existed.

### 🌐 Peer-to-Peer File Sharing (2001)
- After Napster was blocked, I prototyped a simple decentralized file-sharing tool in Java.

### 📶 Neighborhood Wi-Fi Sharing (2003)
- Shared broadband securely with neighbors using consumer routers and custom firmware — an early look at community networks.

### 🍽️ Online Food Ordering App (1999)
- Created for a grad school project — featured menu browsing and order submission well before Grubhub or DoorDash.
