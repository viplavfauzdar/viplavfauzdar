## 🛠️ DIY Projects
### 📡 TV Feed Streaming Prototype (2004)
- Streamed live TV over the internet using a TV tuner card, VLC, and Windows Media Encoder.
- Built before mainstream streaming platforms existed.

- After Napster was blocked, I prototyped a simple decentralized file-sharing tool in Java.

### 📶 Neighborhood Wi-Fi Sharing (2003)
- Shared broadband securely with neighbors using consumer routers and custom firmware — an early look at community networks.

### 🚪 Smart Garage Door Opener
- Built with Raspberry Pi, MQTT, and Siri Shortcuts. Includes remote control UI and door status monitoring.

### 📞 Call Center Analytics Tool
- Visualizes call history patterns for supervisors (e.g., transfers, holds). Built with Spring Boot, React, and MariaDB.

### 🍽️ Online Food Ordering App (1999)
- Created for a grad school project — featured menu browsing and order submission well before Grubhub or DoorDash.
